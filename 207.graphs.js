/*
Graphs - what is it? Nodes + Connections to those nodes 
    uses for graphs - social netowrks, location / mapping, routing (mev arb)
Essential Graph Terms : 
    Vertex - Node
    Edge - Connection between nodes
Different types of graphs - compare
    Undirected vs Direct Graphs
        Undirected - No direction on an edge - facebook 
        Driected Graph - Represented with arrows - instagram - follow one way 
        Weighted Graph - assign a value to the edges (mev arb?)
Implement a graph using an adjacency list 
Traverse through the graph - BFS and DFS
Compare traversal
