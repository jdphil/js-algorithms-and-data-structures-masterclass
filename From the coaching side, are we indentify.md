From the coaching side, are we indentifying people who want to move from Senior to Principal or Practice lead? 
From what I'm hearing there is a lack of people who want to progress along the promotion path. Why do we as a group think that is? What can we do to change that? 
How do we also ensure that senior consultants who want to stay as senior consultants don't think doing so is the "wrong answer"?

Articles process - make more use of JIRA. People who don't want to write an article could help with research and proof reading. Agree with Vikkas we need more strucutre in terms of 
what we release and in what order, make it more coherant. Put up topics and prioritise. Have a reaseach step where anyone could add relevent links, thoughts. Have a proof read step. 
Should the articles be on sharepoint or confluence, rather than word docs being emailed around - tracked changes 

Before publish thresholds to pass: 
1. Spelling Grammar 
2. What messsage are we portraying? 
3. How does it help Liqueo 

Should we consider monetising article writing? $100 - $200 per piece
