//whats a tree? nodes (like a linked list) parent / child relationship / branching 
//upside down tree... top down

//list are linear
//trees are not - linked lists have one path
//trees have many paths
// SLL - is a special tree with only one pathway 

//a node can only point to a child / that would be a graph 

//a tree must have a root one entry point top point in a tree
//a child is a node directly connected to another node 
//parent the converse notion of a child 
//siblings - a group of nodes with the same parent 
//leaf - a node with no children 
//edge - the connection between one node and another

//kinds of trees 
//tress
//binary trees
//binary search trees 

//what are trees used for? 
//html dom - parent / child elements - DOM 
//network routing 
//abstract syntax language 
//ai - tick tack tow
//computer files as a tree structure
//json is a tree structure

//binary search trees - bst - ordered numbers (could be strings) 
//every number less than the parent is to left
//number gt parent to right 


//******************************* */

//How BSTS work
/*
*Every parent node has at most two children - hence binary 
*Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent 
*Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent 
This helps us to find and search faster
